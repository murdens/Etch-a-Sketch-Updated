Etch-a-Sketch Updated

Assignment:

- Create a grid using JS and append to HTML container
- Change colour of the divs in grid as mouse hovers, include random RGB values also.
- Add prompt to ask user how many squares per grid
- run functions from click of button tags in HTML


Additions to first repo
- Refactored button press event code.
- Added canvas size button so now allows user to combine default grey and colour on canvas
- Attempted to allow touch screen event - not as responsive as needed though.  Potentially more options if use frameworks?
